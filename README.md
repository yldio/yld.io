The website is built and deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) to our production environment ([https://yld.io](https://yld.io)) when:

Also, for each Pull Request that's open, a [Deploy Preview](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/) is created, allowing for that branch to be tested and shared amongst stakeholders.
